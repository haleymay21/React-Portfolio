            I am a multidisciplinary developer from the SF bay area, currently
            based out of Honolulu, HI. I am newly graduated from UC Berkeley's
            full-stack bootcamp and I have a passion for creative and engaging
            user interfaces, and applications that provide a helpful service. In
            my spare time you can find me somewhere in the mountains or the
            ocean, or curled up playing Zelda at home (patiently waiting for the
            2023 release). I'm always looking for ways to
            use my skills in software development to contribute to social causes
            i feel passionately about. From climate change and conservation, to
            houselessness, health care availability and civil and womens rights
            - I'm hoping i can use my skills in coding to give back. Feel free
            to drop me a line with any questions or opportunites ðŸ˜Š
