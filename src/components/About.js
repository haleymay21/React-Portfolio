            I am a multidisciplinary developer from the SF bay area, currently
            based out of Honolulu, HI. I am newly graduated from UC Berkeley's
            full-stack bootcamp and am inspired by accesible, human-centred and
            useful applications. In my spare time you can find me somewhere in
            the mountains or the ocean, or curled up playing Zelda at home. I'm
            always looking for ways to use my skills in software development to
            contribute to social causes i feel passionately about. From climate
            change and conservation, to houselessness, health care availability
            and civil and womens rights - I'm hoping i can use my skills in
            coding to give back. Feel free to drop me a line with any questions
            or opportunites ðŸ˜Š
